        <h2 style="text-align: center;">My Learning Plan</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
     <h3> Career Path:</h3>
      <p>My initial goal is to be good at full-stack development with focus on back-end. I wish to be in full-stack development for 4-6 years.During the later part of this period, (after I am fairly confident in my game), I wish to expand my knowledge to other programming languages such as Python or Java.</p>
      <p>Later, I would like to venture into IoT development and be in it for a few years. I wish to be in a programming related role for my foreseeable future</p>
        <br>
      <h3>My Strengths: (in relation to learning)</h3>
      <p>Persistence - I continue to strive until a task is accomplished. I make repeated attempts and donâ€™t easily give-up.
        </p>
        <p>Analytical skills - I have good analytical skills and am logical. This will help me in problem solving.
          </p>
          <p>Seeking knowledge - I have a natural curiosity and inquisitive nature to know more things.</p>
       <br>
      <h3>My Limitations: (in relation to learning)</h3>
      <p>Learning Pace - I am not a fast learner. I take time to understand things. 
        </p>
        <p>Impatient - I am a bit impatient. I expect things too soon.
          </p>
          <p>Taking criticism - I am learning not to take criticisms personally and to take them in a positive way.</p>
       <br>
      <h3>Core Skills I want to develop:</h3>
      <p>I would like to improve my self-confidence. I also want to get better at relating with people.</p>
       <br>
      <h3>Workload management - Plan:</h3>
      <p>I am going to be focusing full-time on the EDA bootcamp. I do not have any other commitments.
        </p>
        <p>I have come-up with a good daily schedule which I have been sticking to for the past two weeks. I have planned 8 hours of work time with intermittent breaks and switching between other activities. I also have time for leisure. During the 9-week boot camp I will slightly increase my work time to 9-10 hours a day.</p>
          <p>At the start of each sprint, I will quickly review the topics that are planned for a particular sprint/week along with the time requirements and have a game plan. I plan to be always ahead of time keeping some buffer in case needed. My strategy is to keep asking two times a day whether I am on track, keeping in mind the game plan. When things are building up and additional effort is needed, I will use my weekend time.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Seeking help - Plan:</h3>
          <p>Firstly, I will look for answers in google, stackoverflow etc.Secondly, I will ask for help in the appropriate slack channel. Thirdly, I will ask for help from the facilitator. I will try for 45 mins before I seek help from facilitators.</p>
       <br>
      <h3>My expectation from Facilitation team:</h3>
      <p>Mentorship, help and support is what I expect from my facilitator. I also would like my facilitator to critique my work, providing me with positive comments and more importantly negative comments, because that is the only way to improve. If I am not given any negative comments, I will assume all is done well. So there is no room for improvement.</p>
        <p>Also, I would like my facilitator to provide feedback on my soft skills such as people relations, patience, tolerance, communication etc.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Block-out times:</h3>
        <p>Nothing really. I will have to pick-up my daughter from school at 5.30 pm if we are in alert level 2 or lower.</p>

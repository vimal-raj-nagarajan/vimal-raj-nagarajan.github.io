  <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
<p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to notice and understand our emotion and other people's emotion. And use this information to guide our behaviour.</p>


<h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
<p>IQ is the measure of intelligence of a person. It includes problem solving skills analytical thinking, memory etc.
EQ is a measure of a person's empathy, social skills etc. It is the person's ability to relate to others.</p>

<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
<p>Knowing about our own and other's emotion will help to do the right things. A good EQ is important to have a happy life both personally and professionally. Since we live in a society with other people having emotions as us, it is important to have a good EQ.
  EQ in my opinion is an important skill required for good people relationships.</p>

     <h3>My core personal values</h3>
      
     <p>I took the 'Myer Briggs' test from two different sources which gave out slightly different results.</p>
      <p>As per the first Myer Briggs test my personality type is 'INTJ' - Architects. On this test the N part hovers at 56% meaning, it could alsoe be S </p>
      <p>As per the second Myer Briggs test my personality type is 'ISTJ' </p>
      <P>I am unable to decide between which one correctly reflects my personality</P>
      <p>My core values are Personal development; Exploring in all aspects of life; Health & Wealth; and Integrity.</p>
      
      <p>I was born and raised in India where we are expected to live as per expectations of other people, to be successful etc. When I realised that i want to make a career switch by forgoing a stable, well-paying job, I still went ahead and took the necessary step.</p>
      
      <h3>Strengths:</h3>
      My strengths are persistence, integrity, willingness to try-out different things, striving to be better. My other values such as achievement, Knowledge & Wisdom will help to tackle hard problems until I get to grips with it. As I have persistence, I give my best to achieve what I have set forth. I make repeated attempts to reach my target. 

      <h3>Limitations:</h3>
      <p>Confidende and Self-esteem - I do not have a high level of confidence and eself-esteem. I wam working towards building them.
      </p>
      <p>Impatient - I am a bit impatient. I expect things too soon.
      </p>
      <p>Taking criticism - I am learning not to take criticisms personally and to take them in a positive way.</p>
      
      <p>I was involved in a team, which was created to reduce the testing effort of multiple smaller teams and consolidate some part of their testing efforts into an end-to-end testing process. The main step in this process is to understand and to learn from them. I faced some resistance initially, as they were reluctant to share information. I convinced them by making them realize that I am trying to achieve something different to what they are already doing. Presenting data from other applications. I also had to slowly gain their confidence.</p>

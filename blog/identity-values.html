      Strengths and Limitation:
      The strengths are persistence, integrity, willingness to try-out different things, striving to be better. My other values such as achievement, Knowledge & Wisdom will help to tackle hard problems until I get to grips with it. As I have persistence, I do my best to achieve what I have set forth. I make repeated attempts to reach my target. 
      
      I was involved in a team, which was created to reduce the testing effort of multiple smaller teams and consolidate some part of their testing efforts into a consolidated end-to-end testing. The main step in this process is to understand and to learn from them. I faced some resistance initially, as they were reluctant to share information. I convinced them by making them realize that I am trying to achieve something different to what they are already doing. Presenting data from other applications. I also had to slowly gain their confidence.
      
      
      As I am a bit introverted, it might take longer to getting to the stage of friendship and learning from others.
      Taking Critisism
      Low confidence.
      
      
      My core personal values are Personal development; Exploring in all aspects of life; Health & Wealth; Integrity.
